# Bladewolf
A Typescript module-based Discord bot engine

## Functions
Any functions listed within scripts/functions/manifest.json will be loaded at runtime, and accessible through the parameters you set.

## Features
> Semi-modular: Add or remove entries in the scripts/functions/manifest.json file to change which functions are loaded at runtime!
> Pre-existing systems allow you to focus entirely on making the bot functions you want.
